Installation for NetBeans
========================================================================

(1)  Copy jrefactory.jar into <netbeans>/modules/ext,
    where <netbeans> is the directory that you installed
    NetBeans into.  On my machine, <netbeans> is c:/netbeans.
    Copy JRefactoryModule.jar into <netbeans>/module.

Reformatting source code
========================

This system provides a mechanism for reindenting your
source code.  This system also inserts appropriate javadoc
comments into your code.

To use this feature:

(1)  Open a .java source file that can be compiled.

(2)  Select Tools from the NetBeans menu

(3)  Select Pretty Printer

     The file is reformatted, and your cursor jumps to
     somewhere near the end of the file.

Note that if the source code would not compile as it
stands, you will see a dialog box that says "Unable
to Parse the File".

Configuring the Pretty Printer
==============================

The configuration for the pretty printer is contained
in a file called pretty.settings.  This file is located
in <home>/.Refactory.

<home> is ~ for developers using Linux or Unix based
systems.  For developers using Windows NT, <home> is
c:/winnt/profiles/<yourname>.  For developers
using Windows 95/98, <home> is c:/windows.  For developers
using Windows 2000, <home> is C:\Documents and Settings.

Before each configuration is a brief description of
what effect making the change has on the system.  Feel
free to change any of them and watch the effects.
If you don't like the results, don't save it to the
disk.

The configuration is reloaded each time you select
Pretty Printer from the menu.

Comments or Undocumented Feature Reports  :-)
=============================================

If you like the software or if you would like to have the
software improved, feel free to send me an e-mail at
seguin@acm.org.

If there is a bug, then please describe what you were doing
when it occurred.  Also, please send me any stack traces
that appear in the NetBeans shell window.  (When I launch
NetBeans in Windows NT, I get two windows:  A Command Shell
and the JBuilder editor.  The command shell contiains the
exception traces that I need to help debug the problem.)

Since this is open source, feel free to add more functionality!
I'll be happy to help show you where to add a particular feature.
